<!-- A variable name must begin with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).

A variable cannot start with a number.

Variable names can include letters, numbers, underscores, or dollar signs.

Spaces are not allowed in variable names.   

JavaScript is case-sensitive — name, Name, and NAME are treated as different variables.

Reserved keywords (like let, var, if, else, function, return, etc.) cannot be used as variable names.

Use camelCase for multi-word variable names (e.g., firstName, totalAmount).

Choose meaningful names that describe what the variable stores (e.g., userAge, productPrice).

Use const for values that don’t change and let for those that can.

Avoid naming variables after built-in objects like Array, String, or Object.

Keep your naming style consistent throughout your code.

Don’t use special symbols or punctuation other than _ or $. -->
